# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.


This project focuses on a simple exchange economy involving two consumers and two goods. We explore how initial endowments affect market equilibrium and individual utility. The project examines market-clearing conditions, the impact of price changes, and optimal allocations to maximize utility. This economic simulation aims to illuminate the principles of resource allocation and utility in economics.
All this is done with python scripts and a jupytier notebook.
